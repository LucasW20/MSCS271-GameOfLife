#Proof of concept Dungeon cellular automata. This code will simulate procedual generation of a 2D dungeon
#For this POF the "cellular automata" will only have 1 generation

#Author Lucas_C_Wright
#RULES:
#STATES: Alive, Dead
#1. Cells change their state to whatever the majority of their neighboors are.
#2. If the majority is Dead, change to Dead.
#3. If the majority is Alive, change to Alive
#4. If there's a tie then change to Alive
